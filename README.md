# prismatic-bot-v2
 
## What is it?
A discord bot made using Discord.js that allows discord users to times which it then stores and outputs in discord. Currently used with the video game Risk of Rain 2 in order to make a time trial that is within a community. 

## Why v2?
Originally, this was created on a outdated version of Discord.js, however that was lacking features and would sometimes spontaniously crash, so another was made, hence v2.
